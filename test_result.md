# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The Add Capital button is visible in the navigation bar, the modal opens correctly with the form, and the integration with the backend API is implemented for creating and managing capitals. The form includes validation for required fields, and the modal can be closed with both the X button and Cancel button. After creating a capital, it should appear in the dropdown selector."

Fixed the issue by adding a helper function to convert ObjectIds to strings. All backend endpoints are now working correctly.

    -message: "Completed testing of Analytics page and enhanced Dashboard search functionality. All features are working correctly. The Analytics page displays comprehensive metrics, charts, and financial summaries with proper formatting and color coding. The search functionality works in real-time, filtering clients by name, product, or ID. Advanced filtering works correctly and integrates seamlessly with search. Visual components including progress rings and bar charts are displayed correctly. The only issue encountered was with capital switching - the dropdown selector is present but selecting a different capital timed out. This is a minor issue as the analytics data for the current capital is displayed correctly."

Found several issues with backend API endpoints returning 500 errors, particularly when trying to access client details and analytics data. The enhanced client form with extended fields is implemented correctly with all required sections and fields. Search functionality and advanced filtering are working correctly. The client editing, deletion, and payment status management functionalities are implemented correctly in the code but could not be fully tested due to backend issues."

    -message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the enhanced CRM backend with all new client management features. Found two critical issues: 1) The GET /api/analytics/{capital_id} endpoint is failing with a KeyError: 'debt_amount' because some existing clients don't have this field. 2) The GET /api/clients endpoint is failing with validation errors for 'purchase_amount' and 'debt_amount' fields. Both issues are related to the transition from the old data model to the new one with extended fields. Successfully tested client CRUD operations with extended fields, payment status management, and mock data generation. The backend needs to be updated to handle both old and new data models."
